# ✅ Tensorflow-1.15-Custom-Object-Detection📸
Custom object detection with Tensorflow 1.15 and custom collected &amp; annotated vegetable dataset. 

# 👨🏻‍💻 Prerequisities: 
-Tensorflow 1.15.0, opencv-python==4.1.1.26,LabelImg

This example requires you to install Tensorflow 1.15 for training, opencv-python==4.1.1.26, and LabelImg for annotating your images

Just type in your terminal:

pip install tensorflow==1.15


# 📸 Data Collection:
I used my smartphone to take photos of vegetables and used the LabelIMG annotation tool to annotate them. My dataset is made up of more than 6000 images of three classes - carrots, cucumbers and bananas. So for every class I have collected around 2000 images. The annotation part was the most time-consuming part of the project. I have made some research on existing online AI-powered annotation tools and here is the list of them: 

## Background/Negative Images.


If you are a newbie to object detection then you might be encountering the topic of usage of background/negative images for the first time. Do not worry, I described this phenomenon in this [article](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/what-is-not-taught-in-object-detection-tutorials-and-books-dc33ab4c3063).
